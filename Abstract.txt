The Newton-Raphson Method was developed first by Isaac Newton and later revised by Joseph Raphson. The method is root finder that can use any continuous function, including complex functions. An initial function is first defined along with its derivative and an initial guess of a root called “x”. Successive approximations are continuously made in order to get a better prediction of the root as the x-intercept of the derivative tangent line is algebraically computed. 	
We also want to explore Winding Numbers (index) and also compare this method to the Newton-Raphson root finding. The Winding method is a geometric approximator that defines a square on the complex plane. If the square contains a possible pathways to the root, it will divide into four smaller squares. This process will continue to iterate until the root is converged upon.
